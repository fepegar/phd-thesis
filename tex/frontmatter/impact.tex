\chapter{Impact Statement}

The algorithms and software developed in this thesis have potential benefits both outside and inside academia.

Outside academia, the presented work paves the way for a data-driven paradigm to diagnose and treat epilepsy.
Our methods may allow clinicians to use data-driven approaches for clinical decision support, as we overcome the scarcity of annotated data in clinical settings.
Our work on classification of seizure videos could be further developed into a product, such as a mobile phone application, to analyze seizures outside the hospital.
The application might help prioritize patients with high risk to be considered for surgery.
The developed software for visualization of seizure semiology may be used for a faster and more objective planning of electrodes implantation and resective surgery.

Inside the academic environment, our work is already being used and built upon by multiple institutions.
As we suggested in \cite{perez-garcia_self-supervised_2021}, our method to simulate brain lesions is being used for brain tumor segmentation \cite{zhang_self-supervised_2021}, which demonstrates its generalizability and potential to solve similar problems.
The EPISURG dataset as well as the dataset of seizure videos features have been made open-access and can be freely downloaded from the UCL Research Data Repository \cite{perez-garcia_episurg_2020,perez-garcia_data_2021}.
TorchIO, our software library for medical image processing, has been used as a research tool at numerous hospitals and leading academic institutions in various countries including the UK, the US, Canada, Russia, China, Australia, India, Korea, Singapore, Iran, Pakistan, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, Sweden, Spain, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands%
\fnurl{https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?oi=bibs\&cites=11818021599290863762}, accumulating more than 60 citations.
The package is downloaded from the \ac{PyPI} more than 7000 times per week\fnurl{https://pypistats.org/packages/torchio} and the GitHub repository has more than 1200 stars\fnurl{https://github.com/fepegar/torchio}.
I was invited to present TorchIO at the UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), the Wellcome / EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), the School of Biomedical Engineering \& Imaging Sciences (BMEIS) at King's College London, and the UCL Institute of Nuclear Medicine (INM).
Additionally, I was invited to present the library at multiple events organized by Facebook: the PyTorch Ecosystem Day 2021\fnurl{https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/pted/2021}, the PyTorch Community Voices Webinar Series\fnurl{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEUVSw5-M9M}, and the PyTorch Developer Day 2021\fnurl{https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-developer-day-2021/}.
TorchIO was also disseminated at the LATAM Minds podcast from the Latin American School of Artificial Intelligence\fnurl{https://open.spotify.com/episode/03gYyFmwWmiY38U30xJ0Zp?si=4bd8e97ca1a74685} and within an entry to the MICCAI Educational Challenge 2020\fnurl{https://github.com/fepegar/miccai-educational-challenge-2020}.

repos,

% The statement should describe, in no more than 500 words, how the expertise, knowledge, analysis,
% discovery or insight presented in your thesis could be put to a beneficial use. Consider benefits both
% inside and outside academia and the ways in which these benefits could be brought about.

% The benefits inside academia could be to the discipline and future scholarship, research methods
% or methodology, the curriculum; they might be within your research area and potentially within other
% research areas.

% The benefits outside academia could occur to commercial activity, social enterprise, professional
% practice, clinical use, public health, public policy design, public service delivery, laws, public
% discourse, culture, the quality of the environment or quality of life.

% The impact could occur locally, regionally, nationally or internationally, to individuals, communities
% or organisations and could be immediate or occur incrementally, in the context of a broader field of
% research, over many years, decades or longer.

% Impact could be brought about through disseminating outputs (either in scholarly journals or
% elsewhere such as specialist or mainstream media), education, public engagement, translational
% research, commercial and social enterprise activity, engaging with public policy makers and public
% service delivery practitioners, influencing ministers, collaborating with academics and non-academics
% etc.
