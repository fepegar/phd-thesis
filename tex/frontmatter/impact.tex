\chapter{Impact Statement}

The algorithms and software developed in this thesis have potential benefits both outside and inside academia.

Outside the academic environment, the presented work paves the way for a data-driven paradigm to diagnose and treat epilepsy.
Our methods may allow clinicians to use data-driven approaches for clinical decision support, as we overcome the scarcity of annotated data in clinical settings.
Our work on classification of seizure videos could be further developed into a product, such as a mobile phone application, to analyze seizures outside the hospital.
The application might help prioritize patients with high risk to be considered for surgery.
The developed software for visualization of seizure semiology may be used for a faster and more objective planning of electrodes implantation and resective surgery.

Inside academia,
TorchIO is used as a research tool at numerous hospitals and leading academic institutions in various countries including the UK, the US, Canada, Russia, China, Australia, India, Korea, Singapore, Iran, Pakistan, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, Sweden, Spain, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands%

The statement should describe, in no more than 500 words, how the expertise, knowledge, analysis,
discovery or insight presented in your thesis could be put to a beneficial use. Consider benefits both
inside and outside academia and the ways in which these benefits could be brought about.

The benefits inside academia could be to the discipline and future scholarship, research methods
or methodology, the curriculum; they might be within your research area and potentially within other
research areas.

The benefits outside academia could occur to commercial activity, social enterprise, professional
practice, clinical use, public health, public policy design, public service delivery, laws, public
discourse, culture, the quality of the environment or quality of life.

The impact could occur locally, regionally, nationally or internationally, to individuals, communities
or organisations and could be immediate or occur incrementally, in the context of a broader field of
research, over many years, decades or longer.

Impact could be brought about through disseminating outputs (either in scholarly journals or
elsewhere such as specialist or mainstream media), education, public engagement, translational
research, commercial and social enterprise activity, engaging with public policy makers and public
service delivery practitioners, influencing ministers, collaborating with academics and non-academics
etc.
