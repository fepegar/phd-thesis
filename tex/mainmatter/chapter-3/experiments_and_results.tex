% \subsection{Experiments}

% All overlap measurements are expressed as `median (interquartile range)' \ac{DSC}.
% No postprocessing is performed for evaluation, except thresholding at 0.5.
% We analyzed differences in model performance using a one-tailed Mann-Whitney $U$ test (as \acp{DSC} were not normally distributed) with a significance threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$, and a Bonferroni correction for each set of $N$ experiments: $\alpha\st{Bonf} = \frac{\alpha}{N \times (N - 1)}$.
