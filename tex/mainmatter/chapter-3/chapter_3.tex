    This chapter describes the output of a collaboration with neurologists Ali Alim-Marvasti and Gloria Romagnoli.
    Ali and Gloria performed a systematic literature review to generate the \textit{Semio2Brain} database, which maps seizure semiologies to brain regions.
    The related publications, currently under review, are:

      \item \bibentry{alim-marvasti_mapping_2021}
    \end{itemize}

    My specific contributions to this project are:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A 3D Slicer module \cite{fedorov_3d_2012} that reads the output of the querying tool and generates a 3D visualization on a parcellated brain \ac{MRI}, where the brightness associated to each brain structure is proportional to the probability of the \ac{EZ} being in the structure.
      \item The software engineering aspects of the project: a \ac{PIP}-installable Python package for the querying tool, including \ac{CI}, and an \ac{API} to access the Python package from 3D Slicer or from the command line.
      \item The implementation of the online demo, which does not require installing 3D Slicer%

\section{Introduction}

% Seizure semiology is a non-invasive instrument used along with video-\ac{EEG}, \ac{MRI} and other investigations to localise the symptomatogenic zone, which is generally close to, or overlapping the \ac{EZ}.

% However, the choice of targets for \ac{iEEG} electrodes suffers from high intra- and inter-rater variability.
% Therefore, the diagnostic pathway for surgical planning would benefit from an objective decision support tool to aid clinicians in deducing the epileptogenic zone from seizure semiology.
% We have performed a systematic literature review to generate a database that allows to map seizure semiologies to brain regions.
% We have also developed a set of software tools that allow users to query the database and generates a probability map of the epileptogenic zone.
% It can be used to support clinical decisions during surgical planning.
