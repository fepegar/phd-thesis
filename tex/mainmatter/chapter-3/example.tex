\section{Example of clinical usage}

% Pt # 771 (0999, roaj) This patient was a 28-year-old right-handed gentleman assessed for epilepsy surgery having had nocturnal generalised seizures since the age of 12 and subsequently developed stereotyped head and eye version to the right with body turning, tonic left leg extension and raising of the left arm with speech arrest. Ictal EEG was non lateralising and interictal EEG showed bitemporal sharp waves. MRI showed cortical dysplasia in the left superior frontal gyrus and Ictal SPECT highlighted superior more than middle frontal gyrus; intracranial EEG was performed to map eloquent cortex and a left frontal resection including the supplementary motor cortex resulted in complete seizure-freedom for 4 years (ILAE 1 for four years of follow up).

In this section, we demonstrate a usage example of our \ac{SVT} with a retrospective case of a patient who underwent epilepsy resective surgery at the \ac{NHNN} (Queen Square, London, UK).
The patient was right-handed and presented head version to the right at the beginning of seizures.
Ictal \ac{EEG} was non lateralizing and interictal \ac{EEG} showed bitemporal sharp waves.

\Cref{} shows the result of querying the database with \textit{Head version (right)} and setting the dominant hemisphere to \textit{Left}.
