\subsubsection{Fine-tuning on small clinical datasets}

We assessed the generalizability of our baseline model by fine-tuning it on small datasets from four institutions that may use different surgical approaches and acquisition protocols (including contrast enhancement and anisotropic spacing in \textit{Strasbourg}) (\cref{sec:multicenter}).
Additionally, we fine-tuned the model on 20 cases from EPISURG with the lowest \ac{DSC} in \cref{sec:self}.

For each dataset, we load the pretrained baseline model, initialize the optimizer with an initial learning rate of $5 \times 10^{-4}$, initialize the learning rate scheduler and fine-tune all layers simultaneously for 40 epochs using 5-fold cross-validation.
We use model weights from the epoch with the lowest mean validation loss for evaluation.
To minimize data leakage, we determined the above hyperparameters using the validation set of one fold in the \textit{Milan} dataset.

We observed a consistent increase in \ac{DSC} for all fine-tuned models, up to a maximum of 89.2 (13.3) for the \textit{Milan} dataset.
For comparison, inter-rater agreement between human annotators in our previous study was 84.0 (9.9) \cite{perez-garcia_simulation_2020}.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluations are illustrated in \cref{fig:finetuning_quant,fig:finetuning_qual}, respectively.

      Rows correspond, from top to bottom, to cases for which the \ac{DSC}
      1) increased,
      2) remained high,
      3) remained low and
      4) decreased
      after fine-tuning the self-supervised model.
