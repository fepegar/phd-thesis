\section{Background and motivation}

% What it is, prevalence
Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by abnormal brain activity that gives rise to recurring seizures, affecting about 600 000 people in the UK and 50 million people worldwide \cite{nice_epilepsies_2012,fiest_prevalence_2017}.
Around 1\,\% of the world population live with epilepsy.

% Personal and global burden
% "I find associated here very confusing associated how -- do people think of these things when they here epilepsy or do you mean having epilepsy often means patients experience stigma, pyschiatric comorbidities and there is an increase economic burden?"
Epilepsy has been ranked by the \ac{WHO} as the second most burdensome neurological disorder in terms of disability-adjusted life years, and
having epilepsy often leads to patients experiencing stigma, pyschiatric comorbidities and an increased economic burden \cite{fiest_prevalence_2017}.
Epileptic seizures, especially repeated, prolonged and uncontrolled tonic-clonic seizures, induce neuronal loss and have long-term behavioral and cognitive consequences \cite{sutula_epileptic_2003}.
Patients with epilepsy have an overall risk of dying is 1.6 to 3 times higher compared to the general population \cite{forsgren_mortality_2005}.
% Deaths in the UK/SUDEP
There are 21 epilepsy-related deaths in the UK every week%
\fnurl{https://sudep.org/epilepsy-deaths}.
Half are \acp{SUDEP},  % 600/year -> 11.5/week, according to https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/living-epilepsy/sudden-unexpected-death-epilepsy-sudep
making this the most common category of epilepsy-related deaths \cite{devinsky_sudden_2016}.
