% What it is, prevalence
Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by abnormal brain activity that gives rise to recurring seizures, affecting about 600 000 people in the UK and 50 million people worldwide \cite{nice_epilepsies_2012,fiest_prevalence_2017}.
This means that around 1\% of the world population live with epilepsy.

% Personal and global burden
Epilepsy is associated with ``stigma, psychiatric comorbidity, and high economic costs'', and it has been ranked by the \ac{WHO} as the second most burdensome neurological disorder in terms of disability-adjusted life years \cite{fiest_prevalence_2017}.
Epileptic seizures, especially repeated, prolonged and uncontrolled tonic-clonic seizures, induce neuronal loss and have long-term behavioral and cognitive consequences \cite{sutula_epileptic_2003}.
The overall risk of dying is 1.6 to 3 times higher in people with epilepsy than in the general population \cite{forsgren_mortality_2005}.
% Deaths in the UK/SUDEP
There are 21 epilepsy-related deaths in the UK every week%
\fnurl{https://sudep.org/epilepsy-deaths},
half of which are \acp{SUDEP}.  % 600/year -> 11.5/week, according to https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/living-epilepsy/sudden-unexpected-death-epilepsy-sudep
