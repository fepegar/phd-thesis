\section{Thesis outline}

% Should I merge with contributions?

This thesis is structured in six chapters.

In the \textbf{current chapter}, an overview of epilepsy was first presented.
Then, the relevant elements in the clinical pathway for the treatment of epilepsy and their corresponding challenges were described.

The literature reviews related to each topic are presented in the corresponding chapters.
The order of \cref{chap:videos,chap:svt,chap:resection} mimics the temporal order of the associated elements of the clinical pathway.

The \textbf{second chapter} (\nameref{chap:videos}),

The \textbf{third chapter} (\nameref{chap:svt}),

The \textbf{fourth chapter} (\nameref{chap:resection}),

The \textbf{fifth chapter} (\nameref{chap:torchio}),

Finally, the \textbf{sixth chapter} (\nameref{chap:conclusion}), concludes the thesis and outlines potential future research directions.
