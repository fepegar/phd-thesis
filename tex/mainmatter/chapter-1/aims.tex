\section{Aims}

The overall goal of this thesis is to develop and validate data-driven approaches applied to several pathway steps in the treatment of epilepsy, especially when the available datasets are relatively small.

The main technology used in this thesis is deep learning, which is a subfield of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data.
We leverage techniques such as transfer learning, self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning to overcome the typical low-data regimes in the context of epilepsy.
