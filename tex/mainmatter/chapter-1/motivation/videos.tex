\subsection{Video-telemetry and SUDEP}

\ac{SUDEP} is formally defined as ``the sudden, unexpected, witnessed or unwitnessed, non-traumatic, and non-drowning death in patients with epilepsy with or without evidence for a seizure, and excluding documented status epilepticus, in which postmortem examination does not reveal a structural or toxicological cause for death'' \cite{nashef_sudden_1997}.
% It is the most common category of epilepsy-related deaths \cite{devinsky_sudden_2016}.
Although the underlying mechanisms of \ac{SUDEP} are not fully understood, several prognostic risk factors have been identified, such as a younger age at epilepsy onset and male sex \cite{so_what_2008,jha_sudden_2021}.

Seizure semiology, the analysis of clinical signs during an epileptic seizure, is an important tool to predict the risk of \ac{SUDEP}.
Some motor semiologies such as bilateral symmetric tonic arm extension (\cref{fig:decerebration})%

are associated with \ac{PGES}, which is in turn associated with a higher risk of \ac{SUDEP} \cite{alexandre_risk_2015,vilella_association_2021}.
Therefore, classifying seizures according to motor semiologies could be used to assess the risk of \ac{SUDEP} and modify the treatment of epilepsy or give higher priority for surgery to patients with a higher risk.
However, manual assessment of seizure videos by neurophysiologists is time-consuming, as videos can be very long, and presents a high intra- and inter-rater variability, especially between observers from different epilepsy centers \cite{tufenkjian_seizure_2012}.
