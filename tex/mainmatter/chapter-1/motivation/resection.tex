\subsection{Resective surgery}

If a definitive localization of the \ac{EZ} can be determined, surgery to resect the determined \ac{EZ} may be performed.
Currently, only 40\,\% to 70\,\% of patients with refractory focal epilepsy are seizure-free%
\footnote{In this context, ``seizure freedom'' refers to one year without seizures from the surgery.}
after surgery \cite{jobst_resective_2015}.
This is, in part, due to limitations identifying the \ac{EZ}.
Retrospective studies relating presurgical clinical features and resected brain structures to surgical outcome provide useful insights to guide \ac{EZ} resection \cite{jobst_resective_2015}.
To quantify resected structures, the resection cavity, which is mostly composed of \ac{CSF} (\cref{fig:cavities}), must be segmented on the postoperative \ac{MRI}.
A preoperative image with a corresponding brain parcellation can then be registered to the postoperative \ac{MRI} to identify resected structures.

Manual segmentation of brain resection cavities on 3D images is a time-consuming process requiring highly trained individuals, and a high inter-rater variability is usual \cite{havaei_brain_2017}.
A tool for automatic segmentation would facilitate and accelerate research to better understand the relation between clinical features and surgical outcomes.
% However, automatic techniques for cavity segmentation are challenging as other structures in the brain may look similar, such as the ventricles, cysts or edemas (\cref{fig:}).
% Moreover, brain shift can happen during surgery, creating parts of the images that are also filled with \ac{CSF}.
Our work on automatic segmentation of brain resection cavities is presented in \cref{chap:resection}.
