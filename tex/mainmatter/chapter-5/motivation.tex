\subsection{Motivation}

The nature of medical images makes it difficult to rely on a typical computer-vision pipeline for neural network training.
In \cref{sec:challenges}, we describe challenges related to medical images that need to be overcome when designing deep learning workflows.
In \cref{sec:frameworks}, we justify the choice of PyTorch as the main deep learning framework dependency of TorchIO.
