\section{Limitations}

Due to privacy concerns, we were not able to share the video data used in \cref{chap:videos}.
We hope that our work will encourage the development of open-access video datasets for epilepsy research, and policies to facilitate the sharing of video data for research purposes.
We hope that initiatives such as the \acs{SUDEP} Data Alliance%
\footnote{\myhref{https://www.sudepdata.org/}}
will pave the way for a more open culture of access to video data in the context of \acs{SUDEP}.

The image data from partner institutions described in \cref{chap:resection} were also not available for sharing.

Despite our efforts to make our code and data available, some of our methods are not easily reproducible to many researchers due to the amount of compute necessary to train the models and the aforementioned missing data.
