\subsection{Experiments}

Overlap measurements are reported as `median (interquartile range)' \ac{DSC}.
No postprocessing is performed for evaluation, except thresholding at 0.5.
We analyzed differences in model performance using a one-tailed Mann-Whitney $U$ test (as \acp{DSC} were not normally distributed) with a significance threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$, and Bonferroni correction for $n$ experiments: $\alpha\st{Bonf} = \frac{\alpha}{n (n - 1)}$.
